Stable version, fully functional

Those actions simulations are available :

   - Keys sequence
   - Move Cursor
   - Paste text
   - Run Windows system specific command (open files, folders, executables, url, shut down pc, reboot, kill processes, create files...)
   - Wait

And other features like data management, scheduled tasks at system startup, create desktop shortcut to autorun a task...
